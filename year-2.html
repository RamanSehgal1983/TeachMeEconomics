                Diving deeper into economic theory and statistical analysis with the second-year economics honors syllabus. This intermediate year marks a significant step up in analytical rigor, moving beyond introductory concepts to explore more complex and formal economic models. You will build a robust understanding of both micro and macroeconomic theory, which forms the core of modern economic analysis. Furthermore, this year introduces you to the essential tools of empirical research, teaching you how to apply statistical methods and econometrics to test theories against real-world data.

                    <p class="mb-4">This course provides a rigorous treatment of consumer and producer theory, a cornerstone of intermediate microeconomics. It analyzes how consumers make choices to maximize utility and how firms make decisions to maximize profits, covering concepts like budget constraints, indifference curves, and cost minimization.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit formally models consumer behavior using indifference curves (representing preferences) and budget lines (representing constraints). You will learn to graphically and mathematically derive the optimal consumption bundle that maximizes a consumer's utility.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base text-gray-800">2. Demand Functions and Comparative Statics</h5>
                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">Building on consumer theory, this topic explores how the optimal choice changes when income or prices change. It introduces the Slutsky equation to decompose the effect of a price change into the income effect and the substitution effect.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit models the firm's decision-making process. You will use isoquants and isocost lines to find the least-cost combination of inputs (like labor and capital) needed to produce a given level of output and analyze how firms maximize profits.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This topic derives the firm's supply curve from its cost structure. It then combines the market supply curve (sum of all firms) with the market demand curve (sum of all consumers) to analyze the determination of price and quantity in a perfectly competitive market.</p>

                    <p class="mb-4">This intermediate macroeconomics course delves into aggregate demand and supply. It formally derives the IS-LM model for a closed economy and extends it to an open economy using the Mundell-Fleming model. The course analyzes the effects of fiscal and monetary policy under different exchange rate regimes.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This topic introduces the primary model used to explain short-run economic fluctuations. You will learn to derive the Aggregate Demand (AD) and Aggregate Supply (AS) curves and use them to analyze the effects of shocks and policies on output and the price level.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit provides a deep dive into the IS (Investment-Saving) and LM (Liquidity-Money) model. You will formally derive both curves and use the framework to analyze the short-run effectiveness of fiscal policy (government spending, taxes) and monetary policy (money supply).</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This topic extends the IS-LM model to an open economy by adding a Balance of Payments (BP) curve. This powerful model allows for the analysis of economies that trade goods and assets with the rest of the world, incorporating exchange rates and capital flows.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">Using the Mundell-Fleming model, you will compare the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy under two different systems. You'll discover why monetary policy is powerful with flexible exchange rates, while fiscal policy is more effective with fixed exchange rates.</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit introduces the Solow-Swan model, the most famous model of long-run economic growth. You will use it to understand how capital accumulation, population growth, and technological progress determine a country's standard of living and long-run growth rate.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3">Core Course 10: Introductory Econometrics</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">This course provides a comprehensive introduction to econometrics. It focuses on the theory and application of the classical linear regression model, teaching students how to estimate economic relationships using real-world data and how to deal with common problems that arise in empirical work. This is a foundational course for anyone interested in applied economics.</p>

                            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base text-gray-800">1. The Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM)</h5>
                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit introduces the foundational model for econometric analysis. You will learn the key assumptions of the CLRM, which are necessary for our estimation techniques to have desirable properties.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base text-gray-800">2. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Estimation</h5>
                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This topic covers the most common method for estimating the parameters of a regression model. You will learn how OLS works (minimizing the sum of squared residuals) and how to interpret the resulting coefficients (e.g., "a one-unit increase in X is associated with a Y-unit increase in Z").</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit teaches you how to test the statistical significance of your results using t-tests and F-tests. You will also learn how to choose the correct variables and functional form for your model to avoid specification errors.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This topic explores what happens when the CLRM assumptions are violated, a common problem in real-world data. You will learn to detect and correct for issues like heteroskedasticity (non-constant variance) and multicollinearity (highly correlated independent variables).</p>

                            <p class="ml-4 text-gray-600">This unit introduces a powerful tool for incorporating categorical information into your models. You will learn to use dummy (binary) variables to capture the effects of factors like gender, location, or the impact of a policy change.</p>
